This is a sight reading app designed to help you practice your music
reading skills. You can use it with the on-screen piano for a quick session
as well as with any of your MIDI devices (MIDI support is available in
Chrome 43+). Play it online at http://cristiandima.github.io/mahler/.

I've been learning how to play piano for the last few months and built this to
help me practice my music reading skills. The app is fairly simple at this
point in time and doesn't have too many features. I might add a few more things
as I use the app but I don't think I will try to take it to a very advanced
level. This will probably be most helpful to people who are just starting to
learn how to read music.

The sheet music is rendered using the open source [vexflow][1] library.
